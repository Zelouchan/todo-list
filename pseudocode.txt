won't allow fields with no input
create a new project clears contentbox

Create Task
    task name
      Expand task for edit and details
        \\ pop up screen or no wait when drop down button is click delete innerhtml=>new one with info
    details project can be editted
        ?? how to edit data, have it stay in input field
    
Main User Interface 
    nav bar - sort projects by due date
        \\ populate with example projects
    add projects button
        \\ once new project is created will take to project page

Random notes and reminders
    Default project when app opens is first due
    sort tasks in project either by due date OR priority
    Make sure no error if there is nothing in local storage

Extra Credit
    Calendar with task due dates
